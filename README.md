# GettingAndCleaningData - Course Project

This GitHub repository contains the R code "run_analysis.R" and the R markdown "run_analysis.html" which tidies up the data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The data is described in detail here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data used can be found here:

The course project instructs students to do the following:

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The second, independent dataset is included in this GitHub repository and is called "summarydata.txt". This data is tab-delimeted.
